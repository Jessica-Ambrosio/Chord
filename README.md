# Chord

This repository contains an implementation of the Chord protocol through HTTP requests.  

Updates:
	- We'll be using the socketIO library. It allows us to create chat rooms 
	and to handle messages just as nicely as the qt library. 
	- Create a virtual environment in a folder in the zoo and install the following:
		- flask, requests, flask_socketio
		- This will let us run our app in the zoo. 
	- To show how CHORD works, we can record the screens of multiple machines in the zoo.
	  To simplify things, we could also have a form that allows the user to input the ip address and port of a known, stable Chord user that it can connect to.
